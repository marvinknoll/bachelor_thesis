I want to express my profound appreciation to my supervisor Frank Trollmann for his invaluable patience and guidance. I am also grateful to my second supervisor, Ulrich von Zadow, for his valuable work in helping me to refine my research and achieve a better final result. Finally, I thank Carla Mortensen for her precious help with formatting and vocabulary support.
