\section{Research question and sub-questions}

The research question for this study is: 

\begin{quote}
    Is a robot with a 180-degree horizontally rotatable colour sensor more time-, energy-, and cost-efficient than a robot with a fixed colour sensor solving simply connected line mazes?
\end{quote}

\noindent The sub-questions are:\\

\begin{tabular}{p{1cm} p{12cm}}
    \textbf{Q$_{1}$:} & Is it possible to control the motor that turns the sensor via ROS2 and nxt-python precisely enough to scan intersections and realign the robot? \\
    \textbf{Q$_{2}$:} & Which robot configuration is most reliable for following the lines, scanning the intersections and solving the maze?
\end{tabular}
